# surveil
A script to surveil in Linux, using a web camera.  Suitable for running a demo
board, or other single-user computer, for example because a password is
passed on the command line.

Note: On demoboards ffmpeg may use some time to compile a video, the system
I'm running has 4 cores, which enables several videos to be compiled at once
without bogging down the system.
