# surveil
A script to surveil in Linux, using a web camera

Note: On demoboards ffmpeg may use some time to compile a video, the system
I'm running has 4 cores, which enables several videos to be compiled at once
without bogging down the system.

Todo: FIX framerate so that VLC can play the video; currently using mpv to 
play videos created.
